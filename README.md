# Profile Page
### Homework for Web Development Class
This is an assignment to write a professional profile website with real information about myself. The pages are responsive. They provide my contact information, links to my resume, and LinkedIn and GitHub pages. There is a page that links to some of the projects that I have been working on in the UofO Coding Bootcamp.

## Content
### Profile Page

You can see that I used icons from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the contact and see more section. The page was also mostly styled using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

## Portfolio Page
