						I am a QA Engineer with over 19 years of experience testing mobile and web applications. I have tested software for small companies, and large fortune 500 companies. I have led QA teams, and collaborated with cross-functional teams to accomplish project goals using Agile and Waterfall methodologies. I have extensive experience improving software quality using manual and automated testing.
					</p>
					<p>
						I like to dig in and think of ways that users might break a piece of software, either on purpose or by accident. I am most satisfied when users of all kinds love an app I have worked on, and find it easy to use. I have started to become proficient in writing automation, and I like the way automating tests helps me think more about how I would test manually, and vice versa. 
					</p>
					<p>
						My desire to become more technically proficient led me to take CS classes at PSU, and to enroll in a web development bootcamp. Being able to keep learning and growing my skills is a huge motivator for me. It's probably the biggest reason I've continued to work in the tech industry.
